EXECUTIVE SUMMARY — Store Trial Evaluation
-----------------------------------------

This report evaluates the impact of the store trial conducted across selected trial locations. 
The objective was to determine whether the implemented trial strategy led to measurable and statistically significant improvements in store performance.

KEY FINDINGS:
- Total stores evaluated: 3
- Stores with statistically confirmed trial impact: 2
- Stores without sufficient evidence of trial impact: 1

DETAILED OUTCOMES:

Store 77 → Store 77 showed a confirmed trial impact. Sales increased by 75.10, mainly driven by higher customers.
Store 86 → Store 86 did not show strong statistical evidence of a trial impact. Sales difference was 886.00.
Store 88 → Store 88 showed a confirmed trial impact. Sales increased by 1372.85, mainly driven by higher customers.

CONCLUSION:
The trial demonstrates strong evidence of positive impact across selected stores. 
Further rollout decisions should consider store-specific drivers such as customer volume and transaction behavior.
